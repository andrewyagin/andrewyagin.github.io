### Process of Development
Design Patterns are essentially, at its most bare-boned definition, a solution to a problem that occurs multiple times or in frequent incidents. The beauty of this 'idea' is that it is applicable to many different fields of work, study, and everyday life. This is all despite the fact that it became heavily utilized and associated with software development as Design Patterns could help programmers write and develop code more efficiently. As a result, I tend to associate this concept to the reasoning and purpose of an assembly line.

### The Assembly Line
I liken the idea of a Design Pattern to that of an assembly line, in that both are a way of developing a product in a more efficient way. For instance, the purpose of the assembly line that we often see in many factories today are purposed with the task of producing more in a shorter amount of time. This was first seen with Henry Ford's _Model T_ car. In which, he utilized a series of conveyer belts to implement a system that could produce a single car in less than a few hours. Over the years, not only was the assembly line applicable to cars but to electronics as well, as many circuit boards and electrical devices are produced in a similar fashion. Therefore, the assembly line is very much akin to that of a Design Pattern as it is a process in which maximizes output.

### Implementing My own design patterns
With this notion that Design Patterns are essentially a Process of thought or development, anyone can use it in the way they go about solving problems. One my most simple solutions is trying to breakdown a problem into smaller tasks. As viewing a problem in its entirety can seem like a daunting mountain to overcome. Breaking it down into smaller 'sub-tasks' can make the overall obstacle seem just like stepping stones along a path to the end goal. I often find this thought process applicable to all of my classes as deconstructing the assignments makes them more digestable.
