### Process of Development
Design Patterns are mostly, a solution to a problem that occurs frequently. The beauty of this 'idea' is that it applies to many different fields of work, study, and everyday life. Although design patterns are applicable in all aspects of work, it was primarily utilized and associated with software development as Design Patterns could help programmers write and develop code more efficiently. 

### The Assembly Line
I liken the idea of a Design Pattern to that of an assembly line, in that both are a way of developing a product in a more efficient way. They are both like a template or boilerplate.  For instance, the purpose of the assembly line that we often see in many factories today is purposed with the task of producing more in a shorter amount of time. This was first seen with Henry Ford's _Model T_ car. In which, he utilized a series of conveyor belts to implement a system that could produce a single vehicle in less than a few hours. Over the years, not only was the assembly line applicable to cars but to electronics as well, as many circuit boards and electrical devices are produced similarly. Therefore, the assembly line is very much akin to that of a Design Pattern as it is a process in which maximizes output.

### Implementing My design patterns
With this notion that Design Patterns are a process of thought or developing a product, anyone can use it in the way they go about solving problems. One my most simple solutions is trying to breakdown a problem into smaller tasks. As viewing a problem in its entirety can seem like a daunting mountain to overcome. Breaking it down into smaller 'sub-tasks' can make the overall obstacle look just like stepping stones along a path to the end goal. I often find this thought process applies to all of my classes as deconstructing the assignments makes them more digestible.
