I am sure many of us have heard it at some point or another that "There are no stupid questions". I have always taken issue with that statement. There are always stupid questions that can be asked. For instance, a question that is totally irrelevant to the topic at hand is the most prime example of a stupid question. I understand that dumb or stupid questions can be asked sarcastically like "What are the answers?" but a genuinely asked irrelevant question is infuriating and a waste of time. However this begs the question: *What is a smart question?*

### So What **IS** a Smart Question?

First and foremost, it is imperative that you as an individual do some prior research before asking your question. After all, if your question is a trivial or simple one, you shouled be able to easily find the answers you're looking for. It's like the saying that some teachers employ: *"Ask Three Before Me"*. If you still cannot find the answer to your question on your own, **then, and only then** should you turn to an authoritive figure. If you have researched your question thouroughly, you can then finally inquire about it online. However, it should be noted that your question or post should meet certain requirements. Your question should be as succinct as possible while also as descriptive as possible. After all, if you ask a simple yes-or-no question, you will get a yes-or-no answer. Alternatively, if your post or question is too long and drones on and on, or if you include your entire 100+ lines of code, don't expect an answer! Who has time for that? You should be objective in your question, don't use anything similar to the following in your title: *"Can you please help me"* / *"URGENT* / *HELP!*, as they detract from what your question. Your title should instead demonstrate that you have done some searching on your own, or include what you have done on your part in the body of your post. Here is an example of a relatively *good* question:
```
What is the “-->” operator in C++?
----------------------------------------
After reading Hidden Features and Dark Corners of C++/STL on comp.lang.c++.moderated, I was completely surprised that the following snippet compiled and worked in both Visual Studio 2008 and G++ 4.4.
Here's the code:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    while (x --> 0) // x goes to 0
    {
        printf("%d ", x);
    }
}
I'd assume this is C, since it works in GCC as well. Where is this defined in the standard, and where has it come from?
