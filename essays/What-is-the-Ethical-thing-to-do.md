### First of all, what are ethics?

  Ethics are the moral responsiblity that a developer should uphold for every piece of code written. As with any job that is closely related to the public, or at least those that experience heavy use from an average person, there is the capability to cause harm indirectly or directly. We can liken this to what an engineer faces when building a bridge, building, or vehicle. As a result of the engineer's direct relation to users and clients, he/she has the ethical responsibility to follow a set of rules or moral compass by which he/she is unable to cause any form of harm to others.
  
### Following the 'Rules'

  So are ethics just 'following the rules'? No, it's not, when we delve into the ethics of software engineering, we will run into some dilemmas, which tend to form a _gray area_ in ethics. Take, for instance, a situation in which a single father of 3 has been working two jobs in order to save up for his children's college education. His oldest daughter worked and studied hard to meet the entrance requirements to gain acceptance to an Ivy League school. In order to attend as a freshman, a deposit must be made. A deposit in which can be met as the father has enough in his account to fulfill the deposit. However the bank call to inform him that a glitch in the system suggests shows that he does not in fact have enough to pay of the deposit. Futhermore, it will take weeks for the bank to fix its system error, which would then exceed the deposit's deadline.
