### First of all, what are ethics?

  Ethics are the moral responsiblity that a developer should uphold for every piece of code written. As with any job that is closely related to the public, or at least those that experience heavy use from an average person, there is the capability to cause harm indirectly or directly. We can liken this to what an engineer faces when building a bridge, building, or vehicle. As a result of the engineer's direct relation to users and clients, he/she has the ethical responsibility to follow a set of rules or moral compass by which he/she is unable to cause any form of harm to others.
  
### Following the 'Rules'

  Ethics are just more than following the rules.
