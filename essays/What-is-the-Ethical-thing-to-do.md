### First of all, what are ethics?

  Ethics are the moral responsiblity that a developer should uphold for every piece of code written. As with any job that is closely related to the public, or at least those that experience heavy use from an average person, there is the capability to cause harm indirectly or directly. We can liken this to what an engineer faces when building a bridge, building, or vehicle. As a result of the engineer's direct relation to users and clients, he/she has the ethical responsibility to follow a set of rules or moral compass by which he/she is unable to cause any form of harm to others.
  
### Following the 'Rules'

  So are ethics just 'following the rules'? No, it's not, when we delve into the ethics of software engineering, we will run into some dilemmas, which tend to form a _gray area_ in ethics. Take, for instance, Case Study 1 (http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s19/morea/ethics/experience-se-ethics-harm.html). Despite the fact that the software engineer implemented the bank's digital transactions which seemed to work for a period of time, it was not in his intention to harm the daughter's ability to get into the IvyLeague College. The situation gives an example of an ethical _gray area_. Despite the software engineer's lack of premeditated harm, he did harm the daughter's chances of getting into the Ivy League college as a freshman. It is a reminder that despite our best efforts, we will wrong some person or another, its a part of the human experience.
