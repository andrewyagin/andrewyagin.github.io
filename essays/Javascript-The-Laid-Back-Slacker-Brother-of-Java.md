# Just what is up with javascript?

With my current experience with programming languages and practice, Javasrcript seems like an unconventional language. As java, C, and C++
have strict syntax rules. By comparison, Javascript feels liberating. However, at this point in time I can't tell if its for a good thing or
bad thing. On one hand, Javascript can have interchangable data types like treating strings like arrays. Yet on the other hand, it seems 
like it'll be easy to confuse variables that aren't constrained by a specific data type. For these reasons, I get the impression of 
Javascript being like those slacker older siblings who potentially, more or less, serves as a percieved bad influence on their younger 
siblings. Similar to Rodrick from the Diary of a Wimpy kid books, Axl from *The Middle*, or Reese from *Malcolm in the Middle*. But
so far it's been an enjoyable language to work with, it doesn't seems to utilize pointers *shudder* as C and C++ does. I cannot definitively
say or determine that Javascript ought to be the go-to language for software engineers. I just assume that programmers ought to have a wide
understanding of many languages. 

# My stances on timed programming
So far, the "athletic software engineering" method of learning has been enjoyable. I like having to practice my skills everyday, since I have
a tendency to procrastinate on assignments that have lengthier due dates. This way, I can practice more often and the solutions on the WOD's
help to demonstrate how the problem should be tackled, which is something that really helps to clarify how my thinking process should work.
One of the things that stressed me out was wondering if I could physically be capable of holding a job related to programming since it seems
like the time constraints on projects would be too demanding of me. But with this form of learning I feel a bit more relieved that I am getting
some form of practice and time to develop my programming skills, to work in these short bursts of time.
