From personal experience, from what I can tell, each professor has their own requirements with coding standards. Although not all of them differ drastically from one another, having to know and understand the nuances between each professor's required standards is annoying at times. However, I do agree that coding standards are an important skill to have as a software engineer. It is comparable to grammar and conventional writing standards. Without them our essays, papers, and other pieces of writing would look like alien gibberish. In fact, all human languages have their own form of sentence structure, so why wouldn't programming languages? I'm pretty sure all of us at some point have come accross the infuriating dilemma where someone else's writing seems absolutely horrible and nonsensical because of the lack of structure. So in that same vein, coding standards serve a similar purpose to that of writing standards: That is to help others read and make sense of what we are trying to convey.

Although both writing and coding standards serve similar purposes, their implementation into what we write are vastly different. Writing standards, on one hand, are harder to check since our way of finding errors in essays and such are through our own skill and experience. And since these skills and experiences can vary from person to person, the standard of writing can differ too. On the other hand coding standards are easier to implement since it is carried out by explicit limitations set by a file or whatever. Being able to keep up with the standard, however, can be infuriating and take a painstaking amount of diligence as any small little detail can or may be confusing to fix. One of the examples that come to mind is the use of underscore functions in IntelliJ, despite having the underscore library loaded in my html file and running fine in Chrome, the javascript file warns about the underscore function being undefined and therefore my code does not meet the coding standards.

All in all, I think that coding standards are important skill to learn. Although it can be confusing as some people have their own preferences, writing standards also vary from person to person-which makes sense. Fortunately, the most coding standards tend to follow the same "guidelines" with little differences here and there.
