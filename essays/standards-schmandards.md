From personal experience, from what I can tell, each professor has their own requirements with coding standards. Although not all of them differ drastically from one another, having to know and understand the nuances between each professor's required standards is annoying at times. However, I do agree that coding standards are an important skill to have as a software engineer. It is comparable to grammar and conventional writing standards. Without them our essays, papers, and other pieces of writing would look like alien gibberish. In fact, all human languages have their own form of sentence structure, so why wouldn't programming languages? I'm pretty sure all of us at some point have read some writing that just seems horribly written and nonsensical because of the lack of structure. So coding standards serve a similar purpose to that of writing standards: That is to help others read and make sense of what we are trying to convey.
