### Shaky Experiences
Before the use of semantic UI, I thought that the current form of developing websites by using pure HTML and CSS was old and dull. After gaining some experience and 'dipping my toes' into the Semantic UI waters, I prefer it over the old HTML and CSS way. Even though I still have some troubles with it, like navigating through the many **div** tags, it does seem much more comfortable and comprehensive way of implementing a modern looking website. But besides the difficulty discerning the tags within tags, completing the unique classes were relatively simple and easy to understand. For that reason, I appreciate the functionality of Semantic UI. 

### Pro's and Con's?
Just like learning a spoken language, I suppose learning new programming languages, and UI Frameworks can all be equally tricky. I believe its in due part to the fact that each have their own sets of rules and proper use. Things like grammar, syntax, and the appropriate use of classes create difficulties in properly employing the use of all three "languages." However, the properties as mentioned earlier serve an integral role in writing code or essays that flow well through the proper structure. So despite the struggles of having to be particular in the way your code is written, doing so will make it easier for others to understand what you are trying to do in your lines. Which is important since the purpose of writing a piece of code or an essay is to depict an idea to a reader or audience. The only real difference between programming and written language is that code is more particular in its rules since the computer cannot convey your thought correctly unless you are exact. On the other hand, written and spoken languages use inferences and guesses and are fluid as a result.
