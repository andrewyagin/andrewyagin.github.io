### My Shaky Experiences
Prior to the use of semantic UI, I thought that the current form of developing websites, that is by using pure HTML and CSS, was old and dull. Although I do not know if it is possible to get a similar design through HTML and CSS, I think I would rather prefer Semantic UI. Despite the fact that I still have some troubles with it, primarily with that of navigating throught the many **div** tags, it does seem much more easier to implement a modern looking website. But besides the difficulty discerning the tags within tags, implementing the special types of classes were relatively simple and easy to understand. For that reason, I appreciate the functionality of Semantic UI.

### Pro's and Con's?
Just like learning a spoken language, I suppose learning new programming languages and UI Frameworks can all be equally difficult. I believe its in due part to the fact that each have their own sets of rules and proper use. Things like grammar, syntax, and the proper use  of classes create difficulties in properly employing the use of all three "languages". However, the aforementioned properties serve an integral role in writing code or essays that flow well through proper structure.
