### My Shaky Experiences
Prior to the use of semantic UI, I thought that the current form of developing websites, that is by using pure HTML and CSS, was old and dull. Although I do not know if it is possible to get a similar design through HTML and CSS, I think I would rather prefer Semantic UI. Despite the fact that I still have some troubles with it, primarily with that of navigating throught the many **div** tags, it does seem much more easier to implement a modern looking website. But besides the difficulty discerning the tags within tags, implementing the special types of classes were relatively simple and easy to understand. For that reason, I appreciate the functionality of Semantic UI.

### Pro's and Con's?
Just like learning a spoken language, I suppose learning new programming languages and UI Frameworks can all be equally difficult. I believe its in due part to the fact that each have their own sets of rules and proper use. Things like grammar, syntax, and the proper use  of classes create difficulties in properly employing the use of all three "languages". However, the aforementioned properties serve an integral role in writing code or essays that flow well through proper structure. So despite the struggles of having to be particular in the way your code is written, doing so will make it easier for others to understand what you are trying to do in your lines. Which is important since the purpose of writing a piece of code or an essay is to depict an idea to a reader or audience. The only real difference between code and written language is that code is more particular in its rules since the computer cannot convey your thought propberly unless you are exact.
