As of today I don't have much experience with programming. In fact, my journey with programming only began with my Freshman year of college. As a result of my inexperience, I was anxious about my enrollment in the ICS major. Heck, even my first programming project went miserably.I couldn't get much of it to work other than open a window and display some images. But I hunkered down and tried harder for the next one. One of the most important things that I had learned but somehow forgotten over the years was to have a growth mindset.

Anytime something doesn't come easy to me I tend to be really hard on myself. The stress and pressure I put on myself tends to build up and get incredibly overwhelming at times. It was not until I learned about growth mindset that helped ease some of my anxieties. I have come to understand that nothing good comes easy, and each struggle is only a step in the process. It's a necessary evil to grow and develop. As a result, I've come to see programming in this light. There are many things which I can't do at the moment, but I will learn, develop, and hone these skills overtime. With this mindset, I hope to learn how to become a better programmer. One of the biggest skills I hope to achieve is the ability to properly analyze a problem and effectively and efficiently as it seems to be what programming is all about. I also hope to expand my understanding of syntax and such for different languages and to develop a wide range of experiences, perhaps with projects related to web and app development, data science, and networks. 

I have been wanting to learn more about the software aspect of computers, since I have a decent understanding of the hardware aspects. With that in mind, I think it's reasonable that I learn as much as I can from the ICS 314 Software engineering class. What I find the most intriguing about software engineering is moreso related to the job and what sort of things to expect in terms of real world situations. One of my hopes is to understand the job market and what is available to me, so that I can better understand what specific profession I want to focus on in my studies. Other than the job market, I am interested in just how wide and universal can software engineering projects can be, like what other fields could benefit from software.
